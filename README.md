## Excuse me, what r u doing?
You remember Waddingtons Super Top Trumps - Dragons & Magic Beasts edition, don't you?? No? Oh okay. Well it's that, but, you know, on a computer and much more fragile and rubbish. By the way, as if the disclaimer wasn't clear enough, I DO NOT OWN ANY OF IMAGES OR NAMES on these cards, they are super copyright Waddingtons (probably). I am making approximately sweet fuck all off this, so hopefully that's cool and I won't get sued. 

## How does this grim charade work?
Ahem, to quote the INCREDIBLE instruction card included with all packs of Super Top Trumps:
> Any number of people can play. Shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player holds their cards so that they can see the top card only.

> The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out an item from the top card. The other players then read out the same item. The one with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. It is then their turn again to choose an item from the next card.

> If 2 or more cards share the top value then all the cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses again from the next card. The winner of the hand takes the cards in the middle as well.

> The person with all the cards at the end is the winner.

Obviously the computer is the dealer and "the player to the dealer's left" is a psuedo-random index based on the current timestamp of my linux droplet in Digital Ocean (same same). Reading out an item is "clicking the attribute that looks the best". And again, the computer will put all the cards where they need to go (do not touch your screen, it is futile).

## I don't have a username and password
Yes, sorry, I should've made this clearer - you can enter any random shite, and it'll be fine. You only need to remember your name/password combo if you want to rack up your history of wins (which I assume I should turn into a dashboard at some point). Username's are unique btw, so don't think you can waltz in here and play as "Poo", "Markles" or "Testy McTesterson" cause they are SPOKEN for, thank you very much.

### Upcoming features
- no longer need a password, just enter a username, no one gives a shit about their play history
- if the above isn't true and people do care, then I need to build a play history page
- oPtImIsAtIoNs
- actually visualise the damn pile of cards
- tests? lol
